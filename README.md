# Terraform and Ansible CICD Pipeline Setup

This project demonstrates the creation of a **CICD (Continuous Integration and Continuous Deployment) pipeline** using **Terraform, Ansible, Docker, and Jenkins**. The infrastructure is provisioned using Terraform, configured using Ansible, and the pipeline is automated using Jenkins and Docker.

## 1. Terraform Setup

### Terraform Init
**Screenshot:** `terraform_init.png`

**Description:**
The `terraform init` command initializes the working directory and downloads the necessary provider plugins (e.g., AWS provider) to manage the resources.

**Why it’s important:**
This step ensures Terraform is ready to create and manage the infrastructure defined in the configuration files.

### Terraform Plan
**Screenshot:** `terraform_plan.png`

**Description:**
The `terraform plan` command provides an execution plan, showing what resources will be created, updated, or deleted.

**Why it’s important:**
This step helps verify the configuration before applying any changes, ensuring no unintended modifications are made.

### Terraform Apply
**Screenshot:** `terraform_apply.png`

**Description:**
The `terraform apply` command creates the actual resources in AWS as defined in the Terraform configuration.

**Why it’s important:**
This step provisions the infrastructure, including EC2 instances, VPC, subnets, and security groups.

## 2. Resources Created by Terraform

### EC2 Instances
**Screenshot:** `ec2_instances.png`

**Description:**
Two EC2 instances were created:
- **Docker_CICD_Ec2**: Hosts Docker for containerized applications.
- **Jenkins_CICD_Ec2**: Hosts Jenkins for the CICD pipeline.
  
The screenshot shows their public IPs, instance types, and statuses.

**Why it’s important:**
These instances form the backbone of the CICD pipeline, hosting Docker and Jenkins.

### VPC & Components
**Screenshot:** `vpc_resource_map.png`

**Description:**
A **Virtual Private Cloud (VPC)** named `my_vpc` was created, along with a route table, internet gateway, and subnet.

**Why it’s important:**
The VPC provides an isolated network environment for the EC2 instances, ensuring secure communication.

### Security Group
**Screenshot:** `security_group.png`

**Description:**
A **security group** was created to control inbound and outbound traffic for the EC2 instances.

**Why it’s important:**
Security groups act as virtual firewalls, ensuring only authorized traffic can access the instances.

### Key Pair
**Screenshot:** `key_pair.png`

**Description:**
A **key pair** named `PemOfCICD.pem` was generated and downloaded for SSH access to the EC2 instances.

**Why it’s important:**
The key pair ensures secure SSH access to the instances without using passwords.

## 3. Ansible Setup

### Inventory File
**Screenshot:** `inventory_ini.png`

**Description:**
The `inventory.ini` file defines the target servers (EC2 instances) for Ansible. The command below was used to ping the servers and verify connectivity:

```bash
ansible all -m ping -i inventory.ini
```

**Why it’s important:**
The inventory file is essential for Ansible to know which servers to manage.

### Install Docker
**Screenshot:** `install_docker.png`

**Description:**
The `install_docker.yaml` playbook was executed to install Docker on the target servers.

**Why it’s important:**
Docker is required to containerize and deploy applications.

### Install Jenkins
**Screenshot:** `install_jenkins.png`

**Description:**
The `install-jenkins.yaml` playbook was executed to install Jenkins on the `Jenkins_CICD_Ec2` instance.

#### Steps in the playbook:
1. Install Java (required for Jenkins).
2. Add Jenkins repository and install Jenkins.
3. Start and enable the Jenkins service.

**Why it’s important:**
Jenkins automates the CICD pipeline, enabling continuous integration and deployment.

## 4. Jenkins Setup

### Jenkins Access
**Screenshot:** `jenkins_access.png`

**Description:**
Jenkins was accessed via the browser using the public IP of the `Jenkins_CICD_Ec2` instance on port `8080`. The admin password was retrieved and entered to unlock Jenkins.

**Why it’s important:**
This step ensures Jenkins is properly installed and accessible.

### Plugin Installation
**Screenshot:** `jenkins_plugins.png`

**Description:**
Required plugins (**Docker, Pipeline, Git**) were installed on Jenkins.

**Why it’s important:**
Plugins extend Jenkins functionality, enabling integration with Docker, Git, and other tools.

### Pipeline Creation
**Screenshot:** `jenkins_pipeline.png`

**Description:**
A pipeline named **AutoDeploy Pipeline** was created. The Groovy script for the pipeline was written, applied, and saved.

**Why it’s important:**
The pipeline automates the build, test, and deployment process.

### Build Pipeline
**Screenshot:** `jenkins_build.png`

**Description:**
The pipeline was executed by clicking **Build Now**, and it ran successfully.

**Why it’s important:**
This step verifies that the pipeline is working as expected.

## 5. Docker Setup

### Docker Access
**Screenshot:** `docker_access.png`

**Description:**
Verified that Docker is accessible on port `80` using the public IP of the `Docker_CICD_Ec2` instance.

**Why it’s important:**
Ensures Docker is running and accessible for deploying applications.

### Docker Image Build
**Screenshot:** `docker_image.png`

**Description:**
Checked the Docker account to confirm that the image was built successfully.

**Why it’s important:**
Ensures the application is containerized and ready for deployment.

### Docker Swarm Replicas
**Screenshot:** `docker_swarm.png`

**Description:**
Verified the replicas created using Docker Swarm with the command:

```bash
ansible -i inventory.ini docker_host -m command -a "sudo docker ps"
```

**Why it’s important:**
Ensures the application is running in a highly available and scalable manner.

## Conclusion
This project successfully demonstrates the automation of **infrastructure provisioning using Terraform**, **configuration management using Ansible**, and **CICD pipeline setup using Jenkins and Docker**. The pipeline ensures seamless integration and deployment of applications.
